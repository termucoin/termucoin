# Termubit Snap Packaging

Commands for building and uploading a Termubit Core Snap to the Snap Store. Anyone on amd64 (x86_64), arm64 (aarch64), or i386 (i686) should be able to build it themselves with these instructions. This would pull the official Termubit binaries from the releases page, verify them, and install them on a user's machine.
